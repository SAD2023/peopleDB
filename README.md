# peopleDB

A dynamic website with four pages, meant to showcase server side development:
 - The pages use Bootstrap styling as well as manually written css
 - The application is made through node and express
 - The application uses a MongoDB database to store the list of people
 - The running website can be found at (hosted by Google cloud): https://peopledatabase-303501.uk.r.appspot.com/
 or here (hosted by Heroku): https://arcane-chamber-16021.herokuapp.com/
 
 
 Overview:
 - The first is a home page that asks whether the user wants to submit a person or view the list of people
 - There is a page with a form that collects a name, email, and location
 - After entering a person, the form is validated to make sure all three fields have been entered, and then the data is sent off to the database
 - There is a page that shows the list of people currently in the database; it collects information from the db everytime it is refreshed.
 - The application also has a help page that is accessible from the home page.
 - The application is responsive on mobiles and tablets as well.
